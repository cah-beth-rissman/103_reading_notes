## All about Functions

1. [W3 Functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators)
>A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.
>A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).
2. [MDN Expressions & Operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators)
>At a high level, an expression is a valid unit of code that resolves to a value. There are two types of expressions: those that have side effects (such as assigning values) and those that purely evaluate.
3. [MDN Function Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Functions)
>Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. A function in JavaScript is similar to a procedureâ€”a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value, but for a procedure to qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output where there is some obvious relationship between the input and the output. To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it.
